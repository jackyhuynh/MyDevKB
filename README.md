# MyDevKB

## Introduction

This README provides an overview of my experience in software development, along with the tools and technologies I have
worked with throughout my career. My background spans various software development methodologies, tools, and frameworks,
including both front-end and back-end development, cloud solutions, and DevOps practices.

## My Experience

I am a software developer with expertise in building and optimizing multi-platform applications, transforming legacy
systems, and leading data-driven development projects. My focus includes cloud-native solutions, data visualization, and
automation in software development.

### Key Achievements:

- **Cross-Platform Development**: Designed and developed multi-platform starter applications, including Android and
  web-based TAK (Tactical Assault Kit) apps.
- **Cloud Modernization**: Spearheaded the transformation of legacy systems to cloud-ready solutions using modern cloud
  architecture principles.
- **Automation**: Implemented CI/CD pipelines and automation tools to streamline development workflows, significantly
  reducing manual processes and errors.
- **Mentorship**: Trained over 300 engineers on various software development tools, processes, and technologies.

### Technologies I Work With:

- **Languages**: Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, FastAPI, Flask, Jetpack Compose, React, MUI
- **Cloud Platforms**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, Heroku
- **DevOps Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Nginx, Uvicorn
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps
- **Testing**: JUnit, LocustIO, Selenium, PyTest
- **Data Visualization**: Palantir Foundry, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas
- **Other Tools**: Jira, Asana, ClickUp, Figma, Adobe XD

## Software Development Tools

### 1. **Version Control**

- **Git**: I use Git for source code management in all my projects. Gitâ€™s branching, merging, and history-tracking
  features make it essential for collaborative work.
- **GitHub & GitLab**: I use GitHub for hosting repositories and collaborating on open-source projects. GitLab is my
  go-to for integrated DevOps workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

### 2. **DevOps and Automation**

- **Docker**: Docker containers allow me to create consistent development environments across multiple machines and
  ensure smooth deployments in production.
- **Kubernetes**: Used to manage containerized applications, Kubernetes helps me scale applications automatically and
  handle orchestration across clusters.
- **Jenkins**: For CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins is an essential tool for automating builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Nginx**: Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, handling load balancing and optimizing web server performance for my
  deployed applications.

### 3. **Cloud Platforms**

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: I have utilized GCP for hosting scalable applications and managing cloud
  infrastructure for various microservices.
- **AWS**: I also use AWS for S3 storage, EC2 for compute services, and Lambda for serverless functions.
- **Heroku**: For fast and easy deployment of web applications, I often use Heroku to deploy, manage, and monitor
  applications, especially during the testing phase.

### 4. **Back-End Development**

- **Spring Boot**: My primary framework for building Java-based microservices, allowing for rapid development and
  integration with various tools.
- **FastAPI & Flask**: I use Python-based frameworks for creating RESTful APIs, focusing on fast development and ease of
  deployment.

### 5. **Front-End Development**

- **React**: I use React for building dynamic user interfaces with reusable components.
- **MUI (Material-UI)**: MUI is my go-to library for creating responsive, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing
  front-end designs.
- **Jetpack Compose**: For Android development, I use Jetpack Compose to build modern UIs with Kotlin.

### 6. **Data Analysis & Visualization**

- **Palantir Foundry**: I leverage Palantir Foundry for advanced data analytics, visualization, and collaboration in
  data-driven projects.
- **Pandas**: Pandas is my preferred Python library for data manipulation and analysis, particularly when working with
  structured datasets.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: These libraries enable me to create informative, high-quality visualizations to represent
  data insights effectively.

## Methodologies I Follow

- **Agile Development**: I adopt Agile principles, focusing on iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptive
  planning.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before code ensures that my applications are reliable and
  maintainable from the ground up.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automating builds and deployments through Jenkins and GitLab
  CI/CD allows me to catch issues early and release updates quickly.

## Example Projects

- **TAK Server Cloud Transformation**: Led the modernization of TAK Server to align with cloud-native practices,
  improving scalability and resilience.
- **Army Pulse Dashboard**: Developed a front-end dashboard in Palantir Foundry, allowing VIPs to monitor key metrics
  across multiple domains.
- **Manifest Generator**: Automated the customization and deployment of infrastructure configurations for platform
  engineers.
