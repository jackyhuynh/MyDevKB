## 1. What is Software Process?
Software process refers to a set of activities required to develop a software system. It involves multiple stages like specification, design, validation, and evolution. Topics covered include:
- **Software process models**
- **Process activities**
- **Coping with change**

---

## Software Development Management Tools
1. Microsoft Azure DevOps
2. Jira Development
3. Slack

## How to Solve a Problem (Solution)
When solving a computational problem, follow these steps:
1. **Do not panic!** Stay calm.
2. **Understand the input set:** List out all possible inputs (write them down if needed).
3. **Define the best output:** Clarify what the expected result should be.
4. **Problem statement:** Formulate the problem in a concise statement.
5. **Work through examples:** Understand the relationship between input and output.
   - 5.1 Create test cases to validate results.
6. **Write pseudocode:** Draft a simple mechanical solution to the problem.
7. **Write small pieces of code:** Develop and test incrementally.
8. **Manage complexity:** Break down the problem into manageable parts.

## Team Management
1. Defining the system
2. Managing scope
3. Updating user requirements

---

## Requirement Process
The requirement process includes:
- **Validation:** Ensuring the requirements are accurate and feasible.
- **Documentation:** Writing down requirements as part of the software development lifecycle.

### Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Functional requirements:** E.g., features like battery life, camera quality, responsiveness. Important for software engineers.
- **Non-functional requirements:** E.g., user reviews, ratings, product name. Important for business requirements.

---

## User and System Requirements

### User Requirements
- High-level descriptions of the system’s objectives, meant to be easily understood by clients and non-technical users.
- Common problems: Lack of clarity, confusion between functional and non-functional requirements.

### System Requirements
- Translate user requirements into technical terms, meant for system architects, developers, and engineers.

---

## Requirement Gathering Techniques
- **Background reading:** Research about users, stakeholders, and the company.
- **Interviewing:** Speak with users, customers, and stakeholders.
- **Use cases:** Visual models that outline system interactions.
- **Observation:** Analyze existing systems and workflows.
- **Document sampling:** Review documentation from older systems.
- **Questionnaires:** Gather information from users and stakeholders.
- **Workshops and brainstorming:** Generate ideas collaboratively.
- **Storyboarding/prototyping:** Create visual representations or prototypes for clients to understand.

---

## Software Process Models

### 1. Waterfall Model
A linear process model where distinct phases like requirements analysis, system design, implementation, and testing follow one another. Suitable for large systems but has difficulty accommodating changes once the process is underway.

### 2. Incremental Development
- Combines specification, development, and validation activities in an iterative process.
- Benefits include rapid delivery, customer feedback, and reduced cost of accommodating changes.
- Drawbacks include less process visibility and structural degradation with time.

---

## Process Activities

### Requirements Engineering
- **Elicitation & Analysis:** Gathering stakeholder needs.
- **Specification:** Defining requirements in detail.
- **Validation:** Checking the validity and feasibility of requirements.

### Software Design and Implementation
- **Architecture Design:** Define the overall system structure.
- **Database Design:** Design the data structures.
- **Interface Design:** Specify interactions between components.
- **Component Design:** Select or design reusable components.

### Validation and Testing
- **Component testing:** Individual parts are tested.
- **System testing:** Testing the system as a whole.
- **Customer testing:** Testing with real customer data to ensure needs are met.
