## Software Develop Management App

1. Microsoft Azure DevOps
2. Jira Development
3. Slack

## How to solve a problems (Solution): 
Understand A Computational Problem. Problem is defined by:
1. Do not panic! (Calm down)
2. Understand What is Possible input(set) (write on paper, do whatever possible could to solve the problem)
3. Understand What is the best Output
4. Problem Statement
5. Works out some examples (Understand the relation between input and output).
 - 5.1 Create Test case to test result.
6. Write Pseudocode: Simple mechanical Solution
7. Write small bit of code test them to make progress (Develop small and testable)
8. Deal with the complexity.

## Team
3. Defining the system
4. Managing Scope
5. Update User requirement.

## Requirement Process

- Validate the requirement
- Documentation: Part of software development

- Functional requirement (battery, camera, responsiveness) important to Software Engineer and Nonfunctional requirement (Review, Rating, name) important in business's requirement.
-  Requirement Presentation: Specific aspect of the requirement. Depend on the clients requirement (Text file, model, mathematical, Prototype/Wireframes...) and made for specific requirement. More process to understand the problem. 

- Communication
- Maintainability/ Decoding
- Training Material

### User Requirement:
- 1 or two high level description, simply state the problem (Clients manager, System end-users, Client Engineers, Contract Managers, System Architects). Non-technical requirement can be understood by users and clients (Nature Languages)
- Problems: Lack of clarity, Requirements Confusion (Function and Non functional Requirement tends to be mixed up).  

### System Requirement:
- Implement the user requirement to technical requirement
- Details and understand the problems (System end-users, Client Engineers, System Architects, Software Developers)

- Nonfunctional requirement implementation:

### Problem Domain VS. Solution Domain
- Check the scope of the project. 

### Requirement Gathering/Fact Finding Techniques
- Background Reading: about users, stake holders, enviroments, company,..
- Interviewing: USers, Customers and Stakeholders
- Use Cases: Models, Visual based techniques
- Observation: of the existing system and users
- Document Sampling: about the old system
- Questionaires: to the users and stakeholders
- Workshops:
- Brain Storming:
- Story Boarding/Prototyping:

### Tabular Specification:
