Topics covered
- Software process models 
- Process activities
- Coping with change

### 1. The software process
A structured set of activities required to develop a software system.  Many different software processes but all involve:
 - Specification: defining what the system should do;â–ª
 - Design and implementation: defining the organization of the system and implementing the system;
 - Validation: checking that it does what the customer wants;
 - Evolution: changing the system in response to changing customer needs

A software process model is an abstract representation of a process. It presents a description of a process from some particular perspective.

### 2. Software process descriptions:
When we describe and discuss processes, we usually talk about the activitiesin these processes such as specifying a data model, designing a user interface, etc. and the ordering of these activities.
Process descriptions may also include:
 - Products: which are the outcomes of a process activity;
 - Roles: which reflect the responsibilities of the people involved in the process;
 - Pre-and post-conditions: which are statements that are true before and after a process activity has been enacted or a product produced. 

### 3. Plan-driven and agile processes
- Plan-drivenprocesses are processes where all of the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan. 
- In agile processes, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements. 
- In practice, most practical processes include elements of both plan-driven and agile approaches. 
- There are no right or wrong software processes.

## Software process models
The waterfall model
 - Plan-driven model. Separate and distinct phases of specification and development.

Incremental development
 - Specification, development and validation are interleaved. May be plan-driven or agile.
 
Integration and configuration (components based SDLC)
 - The system is assembled from existing configurable components. May be plan-driven or agile.

In practice, most large systems are developed using a process that incorporates elements from all of these models.
