# 1) Scenario to Storyboard 

“Design a review screen for a water park” – Design suggestion came from https://sharpen.design.

For this assignment you will need to first sketch designs then transfer the designs to Figma. Come up with a fake waterpark that has been open for at least five years. Design a screen on a website or mobile app that allows park goers to both see reviews and post a review of their experiences at the water park.
