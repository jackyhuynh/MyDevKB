# Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

## User Experience Resources:
- [Form Design](https://www.ventureharbour.com/form-design-best-practices/)
- [20 UX design examples to get inspired](https://www.justinmind.com/ux-design/examples)
- [10 Behaviour for UX Design](https://uxdesign.cc/10-essential-cognitive-behavior-patterns-for-ux-design-7f0cc2e00d31)

## Group Project:
-	Get approval from the instructor (web sites or app prototypes only)
-	Requirements sections (Adobe XD, or any prototype software)
-	UI/UX is not a programming course, it help designer create a user-friendly experience.
## What is HCI (Human-Computer Interface):
-	HCI is also known as Man-Machine Iteration
-	Human -> communicate with Machine -> complete a Task (we design the interaction interface)
-	Develop usable products
-	Involve users in the design 
-	Not waste energy on projects that no one care about
-	How to design things to minimize the mistakes
-	Nnggroup.com
## The Don principle:
-	Visibility:
-	Feedback: send back information
-	Constraints: Prevent doing something that is not intended to do.
-	Mapping: Controls are mapped to their effects in the world. (like the light switch change)
-	Consistency: Same operation and control through all versions
-	Affordable: Attributes of objects that allow people to know how to use them.
## Perspective:
-	Put yourself on user experience
-	Understanding people, long term and short term memory

## Affordances/Signifiers 

### Mappings (Natural Mapping)
- Mapping is a technical term
- Borrowed from mathematics meaning the realtionship between the elements of two sets of things
- The real function of natural mapping is to reduce the need for any information from a user's memory to perform a task.

# The top picture show a designer perspective (ascending and descending): What is ascending? What is descending?
# The bottom picture show a normal human perspective.

### Affordances
- An affordance is any action that we can carry out on/with an object/environment
- The theory of Affordances by 1977, Donald Norman appropriated  the term affordances in 
the context of  design.

### Signifiers
- Signal things
- Show what actions are possible
- Show how they're done

### Constraints
- constraints are limits to an interaction or an interface
```
- PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS
- CULTURAL CONSTRAINTS
- SEMANTIC CONSTRAINTS
- LOGICAL CONSTRAINTS

### Cultural Conventions

<hr>

## Direct Manipulation and immersive enviroments
### Good user interfaces
- Mastery of the interface
- Competence in performing tasks
- Ease in learning the system originally and in assimilating advanced
- Confidance in the capacity to retain mastery over time
- Enjoyment in using the system
- Eagerness to show the system off to novices
- Desire to explore more powerful aspects of the system

### Direct manipulation's principles
- Objects and actions of interest need continuous representation
- Representations should be meaningful visual metaphors
- Physical actions are used  over complex command syntax
- Action should be: rapid and incremental, reversible, immediately visible in term of effect

### Attributes of direct manipulation
- Quick to learn, but tend to require demonstration
- Expert can use easily: Error messageas are rarely needed. Knowledgable usrs tend to find it easier to remember tasks and concepts

### Users of Direct Manipulation
- Get immediate feedback
- Easy to change direction/course
- Less anxiety due to comprehensible interface – if well designed
- Less anxiety due to higher focus on reversible actions
- More confidence due to being initiators of action
- Greater sense of control and prediction of interface response

### Problems with direct manipulation
- Spatial/visual representations too spread out
- Poor mapping of signifiers/controls
- High level schema can be confusing
- Design may force information "off of screen"
- Users must LEARN the interface
- Poor visual metaphor -> poor mental models
- Can be slower than keyboard use

### 2D vs. 3D interfaces
- Pure 3D have strong use cases: Medical, Product design, Scientific visualization
- 2D can be preferable for simpler interactions
- Go for 3D if the added dimension improves understanding and 
outcomes

### 3D Interfaces
- By using a medical simulation inserted into a large scale visualization (using 
CAVE technology), physicians were able to find a solution, that would not have 
been possible without doing the actual surgery

### Effective 3D•Use occlusion, shadows, perspective, and other 3D techniques carefully
- Minimize the number of navigation steps for users to 
accomplish their tasks
- Keep text readable
- Avoid unnecessary visual clutter, distraction, contrast shifts, and 
reflections
- Simplify user movement
- Prevent errors
- Simplify object movement
- Organize groups of items in aligned structures to allow rapid 
visual search
- Enable users to construct visual groups to support spatial recall

### More guidelines
- Implement dynamic queries to rapidly filter out 
unneeded items
- Support semantic zooming and movement
- Enable landmarks to show themselves even at a distance
- Allow multiple coordinated views
- Develop novel 3D icons to represent concepts that are 
more recognizable and memorable


### Teleoperation and Presence
- Two “parents”:  
```
- direct manipulation in personal computers
- process control in complex environments
```
- Physical operation is remote
- Complicating factors in the architecture of remote environments: 
```
- Time delays 
    - transmission delays 
    - operation delays 
- Incomplete feedback 
- Feedback from multiple sources 
- Unanticipated interferences 
```

## The Design Process:
### 1. Research
- Define Goal, User and stakeholder interviews, personas, workflow
```
What matters to users isn't always what we "think" matters.
Learn form people 'mistakes'
```
- Personas: Craete a personas to create a user interface (target my users). Input from the users. Take information, put aside and consider
```
- Printing personas out and hang it on the wall to make sure we understand our audiences
- Learn from other people mistakes
```
- Competitor Analysis
```
- Evaluating the competition for UX Designers is a little different than marketing or business competitor analysis.
-  
```
### 2. Wireframe
- Prototype: rough design (Adobe XD). Do not put to much in the look and feel.
- May present py paper -> start with look and white so focus on functionality (sketch vs. wireframe)
- Understand user behaviour of user
- Do some user testing
- Create an interactive prototype
- FUNCTIONAL IS WHAT KEEP USER COMEBACK

### 3. User Testing
- Get the product that launch fast

### 4. Look and Feel Design (UI)

# Design Guidelines:
- Interaction-Design.org
- Behaviour Researching
- Loose structure that we want to follow
- Every-interface has diffrent guildlines
- Understands how human brain work
- UX Framework
- Consistency (Footer, Header, Do not call something diffrent in different pages)

# Usability Heuristic
- Visibility of system status
- Match the system in the real world: speak the user languages, natural mapping
- Making it clear that "emergency exit", cancel button
- Consistency and Standard
- recognition rather than recall
- Asthetic and minimalist design
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Do not have email address so that
