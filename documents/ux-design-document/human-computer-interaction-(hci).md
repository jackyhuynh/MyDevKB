# Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

## User Experience:

## Group Project:
-	Get approval from the instructor (web sites or app prototypes only)
-	Requirements sections (Adobe XD, or any prototype software)
-	UI/UX is not a programming course, it help designer create a user-friendly experience.
## What is HCI (Human-Computer Interface):
-	HCI is also known as Man-Machine Iteration
-	Human -> communicate with Machine -> complete a Task (we design the interaction interface)
-	Develop usable products
-	Involve users in the design 
-	Not waste energy on projects that no one care about
-	How to design things to minimize the mistakes
-	Nnggroup.com
## The Don principle:
-	Visibility:
-	Feedback: send back information
-	Constraints: Prevent doing something that is not intended to do.
-	Mapping: Controls are mapped to their effects in the world. (like the light switch change)
-	Consistency: Same operation and control through all versions
-	Affordable: Attributes of objects that allow people to know how to use them.
## Perspective:
-	Put yourself on user experience
-	Understanding people, long term and short term memory

## Affordances/Signifiers and Direct Manipulation and immersive enviroments:
### Mappings
#### Natural Mapping
- Mapping is a technical term
- Borrowed from mathematics meaning the realtionship between the elements of two sets of things
- The real function of natural mapping is to reduce the need for any information from a user's memory to perform a task.

# Truc comment
# The top picture show a designer perspective (ascending and descending): What is ascending? What is descending?
# The bottom picture show a normal human perspective.

### Affordances
- An affordance is any action that we can carry out on/with an object/environment
- The theory of Affordances by 1977, Donald Norman appropriated  the term affordances in 
the context of  design.

### Signifiers
- Signal things
- Show what actions are possible
- Show how they're done

### Constraints
- constraints are limits to an interaction or an interface
```
- PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS
- CULTURAL CONSTRAINTS
- SEMANTIC CONSTRAINTS
- LOGICAL CONSTRAINTS
```

### Cultural Conventions
