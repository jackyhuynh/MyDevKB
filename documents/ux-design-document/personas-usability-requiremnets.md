## Requirements Gathering:
**Requirements Gathering** is the first step of UI/UX process: A crucial opening step in the product development process, Requirement Gathering brings all involved parties together, both from the UI/UX team and the customer team, to discuss all the project’s goals and details.

### Types of Requirements:

Developing this level of understanding about users involves an investigation into their lifestyle, the current products they use, their expectations, use conditions, and more. Getting users to engage with a product is the ultimate UI/UX goal—that’s why it is essential to gather all the right information about users in order to most effectively satisfy their needs.

- Business Requirements refers to all aspects of a project that fall outside the actual product and user, such as timeline, branding, business goals, marketing goals, sales goals, competitors, customer service, etc. Although not specifically related to design, Business Requirements often include aspects that will be of interest and concern to product designers.

## How Do You Make a User Personas:
Retrieved from (1): Not sure where to start? Here are some basic features to include in every user persona. 
#### Name:
- User personas should feel like a real person. 
- Giving them a name is the first step. 
- Avoid general denominations like “John Doe” or “Sally the Thrifty Shopper.”

#### Photo:
- You always want to put a face to a name. 
- Some companies choose to use fictional characters and celebrities as their persona photo, 
but we advocate against this in order to create a new and original identity that’s free of stereotypes or preconceived traits.   

#### Personal motto:
- Just like a photo, this help build out your persona to make them feel more realistic

#### Bio:
- Everyone loves a good backstory. 
- Give your persona a little history. 
- Where did they grow up? 
- Why did they choose their current job? 
- How do they spend their free time? 
- Include some details that help make them unique.

#### Demographics:
- Of course, you’ll want to target users with specific interests, wants, and needs, rather than your perception of those things. 
- Including demographics will help improve your understanding of and relationship with users, so you can relate to them in the way they want.

#### Personality traits: 
- Does your persona have a short attention span? 
- Are they cautious? 
- Do they make impulsive decisions? 
- Assigning personality traits might help you understand if you need faster site designs or the option to comparison shop.

#### Motivations: 
- The goal is to get inside your user’s head and understand how they think. 
- More importantly, what motivates them to use your product?

#### Goals and frustrations: 
- While the scope of a persona’s goals and frustrations should directly relate to your business needs, it’s worth highlighting goals that your persona may have outside of those your product or service directly impacts. 

#### Preferred brands and influences: 
- You can learn a lot about a person by diving into brands they like and influencers they follow. 
- Chances are the marketing tactics used by these brands and influencers will likely apply to you as well — allowing you to craft your outreach accordingly.

## 5 User Persona Tips: Beyond the Basics
There are user persona basics, then there are components that create an exceptional persona that will not only help you understand your target audience but allow you to create better products for them. After you’ve gone through the basic checklist of elements to include in your persona, it’s time to apply these expert tips.

#### Use a map that depicts your customer/user journey: 
- It can be tough to build a user persona, so try mapping the customer journey instead. 
- This is a great way to study how they use a product and find both positive and negative experiences. 

#### Use illustrations and visuals to emphasize persona information:
- Illustrations and easy-to-digest visuals go a long way in effectively adding context and information. 
- To make your user persona guides more memorable, incorporate design elements that reflect each individual persona. 
- While on the subject of design, we also suggest streamlining layouts between persona guides for ease of comparison.

#### Highlight common metrics and key differences:
- To avoid comparing abstract things like bios and keywords, try highlighting one similar metric between user personas. 
- At the same time, different people have different goals, problems, and preferences, so pointing out key differences can be useful in keeping marketing campaigns segmented and your product features focused.

#### Use sliding scales to define user characteristics: 
- While it’s good to be as specific as possible in your user personas, there are some aspects that are better represented on a sliding scale, such as personality traits and skills. 
- Doing so prevents a persona from being stereotyped or depicted inaccurately.

#### Keep them short and sweet: 
- Lastly, a persona is supposed to be a concise snapshot of a particular segment of your target customer base. 
- Any member of your team should be able to quickly look at the user persona and absorb the information presented to them. 
- If a user persona doesn’t clearly portray who this person is and what motivates them, then it’s time to go back to the drawing board.
