# Testing Tools

## Ethical Hacking
- peneration testing
- cypersecurity methods

## GUI Testing:
- Small different can make big different
- Test Link, Button, Color
- Poor touch: icon is too small
- Low image picture
- Test if the app is using ok on different screen (mobile, tablet, pc)(Look at UI test on )
- Content need to look good

## UI Test plan
### We need a testing life cycle plan
### A set of supporting tools: 
- [Build A Selenium Python Test Suite From Scratch Using Unittest](https://www.techbeamers.com/selenium-python-test-suite-unittest/#:~:text=Selenium%20Python%20Unittest%20Framework%20Test%20Loader%20%E2%80%93%20It%E2%80%99s,TestSuite%20object%20that%20carries%20those%20cases%20and%20suites.)
- Automation test
- [beautiful soup python](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [selenium-ide](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/): selenium ide for automation testing
- Capture Replay Models

- GUI Testing is testing on interaction between users and an application with GUI. Therefore, the
task will focus on making sure if the button, the link is working and the color frame of application 
is sutable for the purpose of the applications.
