## [SWEBOK V3.0: Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge](https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/media/education/swebok/swebok-v3.pdf)

## Security Testing:
- Testing user requirements
- Testing Functional and Nonfunctional requirements
- Testing Database Structures

#### Testing Database Structures:
- Test the connection between the frontend and backend
- API Key
- .gitignore is implemented correctly if using GitHub (may use third-party software to check for API Key Leak)
- methods of not leaking data or code injection

#### Testing User Interface 
- (Secure Login, Password Leaking, Hack)

#### Hashing Functions
- Hashing Function In Application (if application require linkage, we will apply hashing table)
