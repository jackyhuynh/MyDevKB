# Unit Testing

## Unit Testing:
- Informal unit testing by the programmer
– Methodical unit testing by the SQA group

### There are two types of methodical unit testing
– Non-execution-based testing
– Execution-based testing

### Test Case Selection:
- There is no time to test all but the tiniest fraction of all possible test cases, totaling perhaps 10**100 or more
- We need a systematic way to construct test case
- There are two extremes to testing Test to specifications (also called black-box, data-
driven, functional, or input/output driven testing)
– Ignore the code — use the specifications to select test cases
- Test to code (also called glass-box, logic-driven, structured, or path-oriented testing)
– Ignore the specifications — use the code to select test cases

## Errors: 
- Errors are create by human daily
- While correctness attempts to establish that the program is error free, testing 
attempts to find if there are any errors in it. 
- Thus, completeness of testing does not necessarily demonstrate that a program is 
error free. 
- Testing, debugging, and the error removal processes together increase our 
confidence in the correct functioning of the program under test.

## Software reliability:
- Software reliability [ANSI/IEEE Std 729-1983]: is the probability of 
failure free operation of software over a given time interval and under given 
conditions.
- Software reliability is the probability of failure free operation  of software 
in its intended environment.
