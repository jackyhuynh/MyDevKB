# Unit Testing

## Unit Testing:
- Informal unit testing by the programmer
– Methodical unit testing by the SQA group

### There are two types of methodical unit testing
– Non-execution-based testing
– Execution-based testing

### Test Case Selection:
- There is no time to test all but the tiniest fraction of all possible test cases, totaling perhaps 10**100 or more
- We need a systematic way to construct test case
- There are two extremes to testing Test to specifications (also called black-box, data-
driven, functional, or input/output driven testing)
– Ignore the code — use the specifications to select test cases
- Test to code (also called glass-box, logic-driven, structured, or path-oriented testing)
– Ignore the specifications — use the code to select test cases
