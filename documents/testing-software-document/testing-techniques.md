## 1. Automation Testing:
### A. Introduction:
- Using a set of commands that enable the system to automatic and continuous test the target system with the ability to record the result.

### B. Example/Explain:
#### Automate UI testing with PyAutoGUI in Python:
- In the GUI Tets (section number 6) I demonstrate the automated testing using the PyAutoGUI package
#### Automate UI testing with Selenium and Beautiful Soup in Python:
- we can also be using [Selenium](https://selenium-Python.readthedocs.io/), and [Beautiful Soup 4](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to perform autonomous test tasks
- I use Selenium and Beautiful Soup for web scrapping and generating data for reports and research... 
The purpose is different, but I realize I can use those packages for finding specific elements (container, images link, button, data ...)
. Then assign tasks (click, keyboard enter) that Selenium allows us to do. Finally, store the script and schedule an appropriate execution time
#### Automate UI testing with Selenium and Unittest in Python:
- Unittest is inherited from the PyUnit, Python Unittest package has 5 components: Test loader, test case, test suite, test runner, and test report 
- code demonstrate of using Unittest and Selenium to test if an image link is clickable
- the script using selenium web driver and Unittest.TestCase to perform a couple of autonomous tasks: test the search box, test image link, test language setting, and test if some element is present
- code retrieved from (2) and some from myself
- install from bash
```bash
$ pip install unittest, selenium
```
- python script
```python
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

class HomePageTest(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUp(inst):
        # create a new Firefox session """
        inst.driver = webdriver.Firefox()
        inst.driver.implicitly_wait(30)
        inst.driver.maximize_window()

        # navigate to the application home page """
        inst.driver.get("http://www.google.com/")

    def test_search_box(self):
        # check search box exists on Home page
        self.assertTrue(self.is_element_present(By.NAME,"q"))

    def test_language_settings(self):
        # check language options on Home page
        self.assertTrue(self.is_element_present(By.ID,"_eEe"))

    def test_images_link(self):
        # check images link on Home page
        images_link = self.driver.find_element_by_link_text("Images")
        images_link.click()
        # check search field exists on Images page
        self.assertTrue(self.is_element_present(By.NAME,"q"))
        self.search_field = self.driver.find_element_by_name("q")
        # enter search keyword and submit
        self.search_field.send_keys("Selenium Webdriver framework architecture diagram")
        self.search_field.submit()

    @classmethod
    def tearDown(inst):
        # close the browser window
        inst.driver.quit()

    def is_element_present(self, how, what):
        """
        Helper method to confirm the presence of an element on page
        :params how: By locator type
        :params what: locator value
        """
        try: self.driver.find_element(by=how, value=what)
        except NoSuchElementException: return False
        return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main(verbosity=2)
```
### C. Advantages/Disadvantage
#### Advantage:
- Reliable: eliminating human error
- Repeatable: test the software under repeated execution of the same operations
- Cost reduction: more tests with less human resources
- reusable: test design one and run at every development step

#### Disadvantage:
- Proficiency is required to write the automation test scripts.
- Debugging the test script is a major issue.
- Test maintenance is costly in the case of playback methods (in the situation when we change the graphic user interface) (3)

### D. Applications: 
#### Kind of applications:
- Automated testing can be performed on any system: embedded system, web app, desktop app 
- On any ongoing development application 
- On integration testing step(test as we go)
- Can also test on the stable version just to make sure no unexpected incident has happened
#### Justify:
Since automated testing is not costly (designed one and reuse every time). It can be used at every development miles stone 
to make sure the overall development is working well.

## 2. Data flow Testing

### A. Introduction:
- Data Flow testing follows the flow of the application ()control flow graph and focuses on the points at which variables receive values and the points at which these values are used.

### B. Example/Explain:
- Using Tkinter package (for Local drawing), and pycfg.py (automate CFG task). 
CFG helps us find independent paths (Cyclomatic Complexity), which leads to the number of test cases required to test the program
- The script simply a while loop
- whiletest.py content
```python
# whiletest.py
a= 10
while(a <= 0):
    if a == 5:
        print(a)
    a += 1
print("exited")
```
- install from bash
```bash
$ pip install pycfg, argparse, tinkinter, PIL
```
- put the 2 files in the same folder or we can navigate them 
```linux
Python path_to/pycfg.py path_to/whiletest.py -d
```
- run this script to test the 'whiletest.py' control flow
```python
from pycfg.pycfg import PyCFG, CFGNode, slurp
import argparse
import tkinter as tk
from PIL import ImageTk, Image

if __name__ == '__main__':
   parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    
    # replace 'Pythonfile' with 'whiletest.py'
   parser.add_argument('Pythonfile', help ='The Python file to be analyzed')
   args = parser.parse_args()
   arcs = []

   cfg = PyCFG()
   cfg.gen_cfg(slurp(args.Pythonfile).strip())
   g = CFGNode.to_graph(arcs)
   g.draw(args.Pythonfile + '.png', prog ='dot')

   # Draw using tkinter.
   root = tk.Tk()
   root.title("Control Flow Graph")
   img1 = Image.open(str(args.Pythonfile) + ".png") # PIL solution
   img1 = img1.resize((800, 600), Image.ANTIALIAS)
   img = ImageTk.PhotoImage(img1)
   
   background ="gray"

   panel = tk.Label(root, height = 600, image = img)
   panel.pack(side = "top", fill ="both", expand = "yes")
   nodes = g.number_of_nodes()     # no. of nodes.
   edges = g.number_of_edges()     # no. of Edges.
   complexity = edges - nodes + 2     # Cyclomatic complexity

   frame = tk.Frame(root, bg = background)
   frame.pack(side ="bottom", fill ="both", expand = "yes")
      
   tk.Label(frame, text ="Nodes\t\t"+str(nodes), bg = background).pack()
   tk.Label(frame, text ="Edges\t\t"+str(edges), bg = background).pack()
   tk.Label(frame, text ="Cyclo Complexity\t"+
         str(complexity), bg = background).pack()

   root.mainloop()

```
- output will be generated using tinker in the picture format
- output: 
<img src='https://github.com/jackyhuynh/Software_Development_Handbook/blob/main/documents/testing-software-document/images/control-flow-testing.JPG'>
### C. Advantages/Disadvantage
#### Advantage:
According to (4), Data Flow testing helps us to pinpoint any of the following issues:
- A variable that is declared but never used within the program.
- A variable that is used but never declared.
- A variable that is defined multiple times before it is used.
- Deallocating a variable before it is used.
- User can clearly see what need to test -> easy to test
- Prevent crashing

#### Disadvantage:
- Time consuming and costly process
- Requires knowledge of programming languages to draw flow-cart software
- Drawing chart manually (hand made diagram) can create mistake

### D. Applications: 
#### Kind of applications:
- Backend, logic application (command line, script), embedded
#### Justify:
- Since the testing method focus on the logic of the application. I believe the test is used for more backend applications than front-end

## 3. Model-Based Testing
### A. Introduction:
- Model-based testing is about automatically generating test procedures from models. (5)
- Model-based testing (MBT) can be applied to the software internal development process, and it can also be automated and built-in. (5)
- Model-based testing is a powerful technique that adds a systematic methodology to traditional techniques. 
### B. Example/Explain:
#### Automate UI testing with PyAutoGUI in Python:
- A case study from Microsoft "Chat System" (5), a system requirement for model-based testing
```diff
R1. Users must receive a response for a logon request.
R2. Users must receive a response for a logoff request.
R3. Users must receive a response for a list request.
R4. List response must contain the list of logged-on users.
R5. All logged-on users must receive a broadcast message.
R6. Messages from one sender must be received in order.
```
- These are the default action declarations, whereas the “event” keyword is used to declare an event action. code below show what this looks like in the chat system.
```csharp
// Cord code
config ChatConfig
{
  action void LogonRequest(int user);
  action event void LogonResponse(int user);
  action void LogoffRequest(int user);
  action event void LogoffResponse(int user);
  action void ListRequest(int user);
  action event void ListResponse(int user, Set<int> userList);
  action void BroadcastRequest(int senderUser, string message);
  action void BroadcastAck(int receiverUser, 
    int senderUser, string message);
  // ...
}
```
- Automated generate code to test each model
- The test-code generator is highly customizable and can be configured to generate test cases that target different test frameworks, such as NUnit.
```csharp
# test code generate by computer for model-base testing
#region Test Starting in S0
[Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.TestMethodAttribute()]
public void TestSuiteS0() {
  this.Manager.BeginTest("TestSuiteS0");
  this.Manager.Comment("reaching state \'S0\'");
  this.Manager.Comment("executing step \'call LogonRequest(2)\'");
  Chat.Adapter.ChatAdapter.LogonRequest(2);
  this.Manager.Comment("reaching state \'S1\'");
  this.Manager.Comment("checking step \'return LogonRequest\'");
  this.Manager.Comment("reaching state \'S4\'");
  // ...
    }
```
### C. Advantages/Disadvantage:
#### Advantage:
- After the testable model is completed, model-based tests can cover an incredibly large variety of scenarios with relatively little effort.
- Since the model has to be formalized to enable auto-generate test, this enables early detection of requirement inconsistencies and helps teams to be in accord in terms of expected behavior
- Low maintenance cost
- Different members of a team can work on different tasks concurrently
- The MBT process can find design and specification errors quickly (6)

#### Disadvantage:
- A mindset adjustment is often required (learning curve). 
- Take time to learn before applying (automated + model-based testing): for developers integrating testing knowledge, and for testers learning how modeling relates to testing
- Took more time to develop the first test case
- If there is a large random test, MBT requires a great deal of infrastructure (many machines), a great deal of time (measured in hours to days for high coverage) or both (6)

### D. Applications:
#### Kind of applications:
- Models can be used to represent the desired behavior of a system under test (SUT) or to represent testing strategies and a test environment. 
- Model base can also use for embedded software systems, back-end applications

#### Justify:
- Model-based testing design to test the model and system under test. 
- Since the testing method focus on the logic of the application. I believe the test is used for more backend applications than front-end

## 4. Mutation Testing
### A. Introduction:
- Mutation testing is a structural testing technique, which uses the structure of the code to guide the testing process. It can be described as the process of rewriting the source code in small ways to remove the redundancies in the source code
- There are 3 types: value mutation, decision mutations, statement mutations
- Mutation testing are widely use in unit test
### B. Example/Explain:
- Example of value mutation using the **mutmut** package of Python:
- install from bash
```bash
$ pip install mutmut
```
- Using a small program as an example
```
(base) C:\Users\truchuynh>mutmut /?
Usage: mutmut [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Mutation testing system for Python.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  apply       Apply a mutation on disk.
  html        Generate a HTML report of surviving mutants.
  junitxml    Show a mutation diff with junitxml format.
  result-ids  Print the IDs of the specified mutant classes (separated by...
  results     Print the results.
  run         Runs mutmut.
  show        Show a mutation diff.
  version     Show the version and exit.

(base) C:\Users\truchuynh>
```
- Navigate to the source file then run
```bash
$ mutmut run
```
- This output demonstrate a small program test
```bash
Language     files          blank        comment        code
---------------------------------------------------------------
Python       10            964           1399           2046
```
- sample of 3 test case
```
1.03s call     tests/test_main.py::test_parallel_for
0.80s call     tests/test_string.py::test_is_email
0.41s call     tests/test_io.py::test_download_without_path
```
- run this to get a html report instead of a text log
```bash
$ mutmut html 
```
- Code sample retrieved from (16) and myself

### C. Advantages/Disadvantage 
Retrieved from (7)
#### Advantage:
- Brings a good level of error detection in the program.
- Discovering ambiguities in the source code.
- Delivering the most established and dependable structure for the clients

#### Disadvantage:
- Highly costly and time-consuming.
- Not able for Black Box Testing (modification in the source code).
- Testing requires the automation tools to test the application

### D. Applications: 
#### Kind of applications:
- typically used to conduct unit tests
- can be used for web app, desktop app, embeded system, mobile app

#### Justify:
- Mutation testing is usually used in unit test and we can use unit test for both front and back end to test the functionality of a unit (7)

## 5. User Interface(UI)Testing
### A. Introduction:
- GUI Testing is the method of testing the graphic user interface (GUI) of a system 
are meet the system's requirements (functional and non-functional).
- Key element of UI testing:
  + Design must be inconsistent (e.g.: header and footer are the same through multiple pages)
  + Do not overuse any element (e.g.: color, font…)
  + Lack of text hierarchy
  + Unaligned element
  + Bad design structure
  + Using Low images
  + Bad render of different screen-size


### B. Example/Explain:
#### Automated UI Testing using PyAutoGUI
- Using the PyAutoGUI package, we can conduct regression UI testing on the target (regression testing + UI testing).
- The PyAutoGUI will allow us to carry out automated UI testing: it works across Windows, macOS X, and Linux which provides the ability to simulate mouse cursor moves and clicks as well as keyboard button presses.
- Code example retrieved from (1) and written in Python: the code will test if Firefox is working properly
  (open a new tab, open a website, type in a website...). We can store the script and execute it as many times as we want
```python
import pyautogui as gui, time

"""
testfirefox() function will turn on the firefox application by perform automation task
then it go to https://medium.com/financeexplained to check if Firefox is able to navigate 
to a web site
"""
def testfirefox():
    screenWidth, screenHeight = gui.size()
    gui.moveTo(0,screenHeight)
    gui.click()
    gui.typewrite('Firefox', interval=0.25)
    gui.press('enter')
    time.sleep(2)
    gui.keyDown('alt')
    gui.press(' ')
    gui.press('x')
    gui.keyUp('alt')
    gui.click(250,22)
    gui.click(371,51)
    gui.typewrite('https://medium.com/financeexplained')
    gui.press('enter')
    

"""
identifyloc() return the current location of the mouse
"""    
def identifyloc():
    while True:
        currentMouseX, currentMouseY = gui.position()
        print(currentMouseX,currentMouseY)
        time.sleep(3)
        

"""
call to test
"""       
testfirefox()
```
Once the above code has been executed, the os can search for Firefox and then launch the website. 
We can write more code to test (button, link, functionality...) depending on our test plan.
#### Manually Testing:
- We can also manually click on buttons and links to test it manually: costly

### C. Advantages/Disadvantage
#### Advantage: 
- Testing the functionality of the GUI (button, hyperlink)
- Make sure the front end work as expected (user input, link, video, buttons)
- Tests the user interface from the users perspective.
- Helps validate the compliance of various icons and elements with their design specifications.
  #### Explain the importance of UI Testing:
  - GUI Testing is very important. A good user interface can help a website make more clients while bad website design can lose their customer.
  - Example: Returning a hp product on hp.com is too hard so I will never come and purchase their product.

#### Disadvantage:
- can be costly due to User Experience (UX) tests reply on humans
- can't test the non-functionality (if website attracts user, ...)
- Not have a clear framework to implement User Experience Testing (UX)
- The process of testing is time consuming and may require extra software for running GUIs.
- Since the interface of an application changes frequently, the team might have to refactor recorded test script to improve its accuracy.

### D. Applications:
#### Kind of applications: 
- web clients and/or server (web applications, web pages, webserver)
- desktop applications
#### <b>Justify:</b>
- GUI Testing is testing on the interaction between users and an application with GUI. Therefore, the
the task will focus on making sure if the button, the link is working and the color frame of the application 
is suitable for the applications.

## 6. Integration Testing

### A. Introduction:
- Integration testing is the testing of various modules of the software under development together as a group. 
This determines whether or not they function together seamlessly as part of the system or whole. 
- There are 2 types:
  - Big Bang Approach
  - Incremental Approach: which is further divided into the following: 
  	- Top Down Approach
    - Bottom Up Approach
    - Sandwich Approach 
    – Combination of Top Down and Bottom Up
    
### B. Example/Explain:
- Integration testing is done on groups of modules to make sure they work together and interact properly. While unit testing is one of the earliest tests performed in a project, integration testing is usually done later in the project timeline.
- Individual model may work well in unit test, but wont work when put together with other units. I experience this before.
- Therefore, automated integration tests greatly increase the likelihood that bugs will be found as soon as possible during development so they can be addressed immediately.

### C. Advantages/Disadvantage
#### Advantage:
- Successful integration of modules: Most projects are big enough that development is broken down into numerous parts or modules. Integration testing verifies that all the parts communicate well and work together to achieve the purpose of the software.
- Data integrity: verify and validate data is not change or corruption when data move from 1 module to another
- User-based scenarios. One of the most important reasons to conduct integration tests is to create critical user-based scenarios and make sure they play out correctly. Individual components of the software will need to communicate properly when grouped, adapting and responding to multiple possible results. (8)
- Third-party testing. Integration testing also verifies that groups of modules or units of coding interact properly with Application Programming Interface (API) tools.
- retrieved from (8)
#### Disadvantage:
- Test cases need to be prepared and testing data created
- A test environment must be set up (cost)
- Unit testing must have been completed already (can't begin test early).
- Greater difficulty in locating faults.
- Potential for overlooking a component.
- Critical, high-level components are tested last.
- retrieved from (8)
- Failing to create stubs and drivers required for integration testing will result in poor testing.
- Carrying out integration testing is challenging and consumes more time
- retrieved from (14)

### D. Applications:
#### Kind of applications:
- web app, desktop app, embeded system, mobile app
#### Justify:
- the intergration between a database, API, procedures, back end and front on most system must be test to ensure they work together without fault.

## 7. Grammar-based testing
### A. Introduction:
- Grammar testing is discussed in the context of grammar engineering (i.e., software engineering for grammar). 
Grammar recovery is concerned with the derivation of a language's grammar from some available resources such as a semi-formal language reference.
- Several programs (like parsers, interpreters, and compilers) that work on structured input can be tested using grammar. 
These applications process their input in different stages like tokenizing, building parse tree, converting to AST and 
evaluating the AST. The simplest way to provide specify the input is in form of context-free grammar (10).
- A context-free grammar or CFG is a set of recursive rewriting rules (also called productions) used to generate patterns of strings. 

### B. Example/Explain:
#### Example from (10)
- GramTest: a tool for grammar-based test case generation.
- The key aspect of the grammar-based test case generation algorithm in Gramtest is 
to follow all the production rules of the given BNF grammar and then generate strings 
that conform to the grammar. The production rules themselves form a tree, the root of 
the tree is the starting rule for generating all the strings in the grammar. 
- For example, consider the following BNF grammar describing all the course codes at a university:
  ```bash
  <coursecode>   ::= <acadunit> <coursenumber>
  <acadunit>     ::= <letter> <letter> <letter>
  <coursenumber> ::= <year> <semesters> <digit> <digit>
  <year>         ::= <ugrad> | <grad>
  <ugrad>        ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
  <grad>         ::= 5 | 6 | 7 | 9
  <semesters>    ::= <onesemester> | <twosemesters>
  <onesemester>  ::= <frenchone> | <englishone> | <bilingual>
  <frenchone>    ::= 5 | 7
  <englishone>   ::= 1 | 3
  <bilingual>    ::= 9
  <twosemesters> ::= <frenchtwo> | <englishtwo>
  <frenchtwo>    ::= 6 | 8
  <englishtwo>   ::= 2 | 4
  <digit>        ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
  <letter>       ::= A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N |
                     O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z
  ```
- Explain:
  - In this grammar the root is:
  ```bash
  <coursecode> ::= <acadunit> <coursenumber>
  ```
  - rule is starting from the root to the terminal
  - when we reach the terminal, we generating a corresponding string (only for that terminal)
  - when we run Gramtest on this input it generates the following strings
  ```bash
  Truc-Huynh:target truchuynh$ 
  java -jar gramtest-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
  -file ../src/test/resources/coursecodes.bnf
  ``` 
  - output
  ```bash
  Generating tests ...

  - Save all the test cases in the "generated-tests" folder.
  ```bash
  Truc-Huynh:target truchuynh$ ls generated-tests/

### C. Advantages/Disadvantage
#### Advantage:
- Automate the testing process
- Makes it possible to express and validate structured textual data
- Combine with auto mation testing to create automated fuzzing and testing 
(for example: Gramtest allows you to generate test cases based on arbitrary user defined grammars)

#### Disadvantage:
- A mindset adjustment is often required (learning curve). 
- Take time to learn before applying
- Retrieved from (10)

### D. Applications:
#### Kind of applications:
- parsers, interpreters, and compilers
- profilers, slicing tools, pretty printers, (re-) documentation tools, language reference manuals, browsers and IDEs, software analysis tools...

#### Justify:
- For such applications, due to a large number of control flow paths in the early processing, random fuzzing does not yield good test cases. Generating tests that exploit the structured nature of the input can provide better results.

## 8. Regression Testing
### A. Introduction:
- Regression testing is a software testing method that is re-run to ensure that a software update does not affect the product's current functioning.
- Regression Testing run the previous test case on the existing application
- There are 3 types of regression testing:
  - Retest all
  - Regression Test
  - Prioritization of Test Cases
### B. Example/Explain:
#### My personal experience:
- Testing the functionality of the whole application after each update is necessary. Sometimes, I experience
apply a patch to software or update dependency then my apps don't work properly. Then, I have to roll back to the
previous version to make the app work (reverse).
- My method of regression is storing the script of each test suite and executing them in order. Regression testing is extremely important and should be treated with high priority.
#### test — Regression tests package for Python (12)
- The test package contains all regression tests for Python as well as the modules test.support and test.regrtest. test.support is used to enhance your tests while test.regrtest drives the testing suite.
- basic boilerplate is often used:
```python
"""
Boiler plate for Regression Testing
"""
import unittest
from test import support

class MyTestCase1(unittest.TestCase):

    # Only use setUp() and tearDown() if necessary

    def setUp(self):
        # ... code to execute in preparation for tests ...

    def tearDown(self):
        # ... code to execute to clean up after tests ...

    def test_feature_one(self):
        # Test feature one.
        # ... testing code ...

    def test_feature_two(self):
        # Test feature two.
        # ... testing code ...

    ... more test methods ...

class MyTestCase2(unittest.TestCase):
    # ... same structure as MyTestCase1 ...

... more test classes ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### C. Advantages/Disadvantage
#### Advantage:
- Make sure the application runs smooth and function right after each update
- when a new feature is added to the software application and for defect fixing as well as performance issue fixing
- Regression is necessary to locate issues that have arisen as a result of a code modification
- Ensure that the modification hasn't impacted anything that was previously functioning.
#### Disadvantage:
- Test case can be time-consuming & cost consuming since we have to test the whole system again at every update
- Minimize test suite while achieving maximize test coverage can be a big problems

### D. Applications:
#### Kind of applications:
- Any applications (web, desktop, embedded, mobile)
#### Justify:
- It is always good to test the functionality of any applications after an update. I experience this.

## 9. Stress Testing
### A. Introduction:
- Stress Testing is a testing methods to determine the stability, reliability, durability and scalability of a software system
by testing beyond its normal operation.
- Stress testing even tests beyond the normal operating points and analyses the performance of the system under 
extreme conditions (limit at which the system breaks or crashes).
- Type of Stress Testing:
  - Server-Client Stress Testing 
  - Product Testing 
  - Transaction Stress Testing 
  - Systematic Stress Testing
  - Analytical Stress Testing 
- Retrieved from (13)

### B. Example/Explain:
Example test plan of a e-commerce app (web app):
- Introduction: To conduct a stress testing of an e-commerce app, a large number of hitting the app is simulated
- Plan:
  ```diff
  - a much higher number of users (compare to the average/ may be double average) is being generate.
  - automate all the virtual user and assigned task supervise or unsupervised
  - simulated (virtual) users' task:
  + View products
  + add or remove products
  + navigate pages
  + check out
  - Test if all user is doing 1 task vs. doing multiple task
  - Test until the system crash
  - Repeated the test under different condition (depend on purpose)
  - record the test
  ```
- Results:
  - Goal is to discover bottlenecks or drawbacks in the system
  - performance improvement or optimization areas
  - design recovery methods base on test result
  
### C. Advantages/Disadvantage
#### Advantage:
- robustness of the system under extreme load
- The performance of the system is measured under varying amounts of data, and users
- Understand maximum metric of a system (scalability, performance, application response, and failures)
to design prevention methods
- Understand ability of a system to recover from a failure or a crash
- Guarantees the system will function under regular and irregular conditions properly.
- Retrieved from (13) and (14)
#### Disadvantage:
- Need to have an adequate knowledge of stress-testing to perform the task
- Very costly due to the requirement of additional resources
- Manually executing stress testing is a complex task
- Retrieved from (14)

### D. Applications:
- It is used for all types of software applications, but is particularly important for critical software. Stress testing aims at estimating the robustness, availability and error handling capabilities under heavy loads to ensure that the software does not crash under crunch conditions.

## 10. Performance Testing
### A. Introduction:
- Performance testing is a testing technique, performed to determine the responsiveness and stability of 
a software system under various workload 
- Performance testing metrics are: scalability, reliability and resource usage
- Type:
  - Load Testing
  - Stress Testing
  - Soak Testing
  - Spike Testing
- Performance testing is a non-functional testing
- Retrieved from (18)

### B. Example/Explain:
#### Example 1 using Locustio
- we can perform performance testing using Python 
- locust package of Python can perform this task.
- locust is coding base package. Therefore, we can store as script and perform this with other testing technique
- install from bash
```bash
$ pip install locustio
```
- Boiler of performance testing script may look like:
```python
from locust import HttpLocust, TaskSet, task, between

class TestCases(TaskSet):
    def on_start(self):
        self.payload = {"email": "john@example.com", "password":123}
        self.login()

    def on_stop(self):
        self.logout()

    def login(self):
        self.client.post("/login", self.payload)

    def logout(self):
        self.client.post("/logout", self.payload)

    @task(2)
    def visit_count(self):
        self.client.get("/visit")

    @task(1)
    def profile(self):
        self.client.get("/profile")

class LocustUsers(HttpLocust):
    task_set = TestCases
    wait_time = between(5, 9)
```
- Run the script above from bash
```bash
locust -f mylocustfile.py -- host= https://template-blog.herokuapp.com/
```
- If the code has no issue then we will see something like this
```bash
[2022-02-10 10:13:16,324]                     /INFO/locust.main: Starting web monitor at http://*:8089
```
- Navigate to local host http://localhost:8089, there is will be a graphic interface appear
```diff
- Enter the number of total user to simulate: 10000
- Enter the Hatch Rate: 99
+ If you give the number of users to simulate as 10000 and Hatch rate as 99 then all 10000 users will be activated within 99 seconds 
```
#### Example 2 using datetime package:
- There are methods that using datatime, timeit, cProfile for performance testing but I may argue that it wont be efficient as the locustio package.
- May end up to manually do extra work compare to locustio

### C. Advantages/Disadvantage
#### Advantage:
- Verifies the speed, accuracy, and stability of the software match expectation.
- Assists the system by authenticating the responsiveness and managing the scalability and reliability of software features.
- Retrieved from (14)

#### Disadvantage:
- Can be a costly mistake if done haphazardly, leading to inaccurate results and conclusions.
- Carried out on multiple devices in different locations to check whether a user faces difficulties. Hence this testing can be costly.
- Retrieved from (14)

### D. Applications:
- Performance testing should be performed for any kind of applications since we all want to know how our application is performed. 
We can guarantee the software applications can handle and manage the workload efficiently
