# Lab: Terraform Provisioners

Provisioners can be used to model specific actions on the local machine or on a remote machine in order to prepare servers or other infrastructure objects for service.

To this point the EC2 web server we have created is useless. We created a server without any running code with no useful services are running on it.

We will utilize Terraform provisoners to deploy a webapp onto the instance we've created. In order run these steps Terraform needs a connection block along with our generated SSH key from the previous labs in order to authenticate into our instance. Terraform can utilize both the `local-exec` provisioner to run commands on our local workstation, and the `remote-exec` provisoner to install security updates along with our web application.

- Task 1: Upload your SSH keypair to AWS and associate to your instance.
- Task 2: Create a Security Group that allows SSH to your instance.
- Task 3: Create a connection block using your SSH keypair.
- Task 4: Use the `local-exec` provisioner to change permissions on your local SSH Key
- Task 5: Create a `remote-exec` provisioner block to pull down and install web application.
- Task 6: Apply your configuration and watch for the remote connection.
- Task 7: Pull up the web application and ssh into the web server (optional)

## Task 1: Create an SSH keypair and associate it to your instance.

In `main.tf` add the following resource blocks to create a key pair in AWS that is associated with your generated key from the previous lab.

```
resource "aws_key_pair" "generated" {
  key_name   = "MyAWSKey"
  public_key = tls_private_key.generated.public_key_openssh

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [key_name]
  }
}
```

```bash
terraform apply
```

## Task 2: Create a Security Group that allows SSH to your instance.

### Step 7.1.1

In `main.tf` add the following resource block to create a Security Group that allows SSH access.

```hcl
# Security Groups

resource "aws_security_group" "ingress-ssh" {
  name   = "allow-all-ssh"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc.id
  ingress {
    cidr_blocks = [
      "0.0.0.0/0"
    ]
    from_port = 22
    to_port   = 22
    protocol  = "tcp"
  }
  // Terraform removes the default rule
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

In `main.tf` add the following resource block to create a Security Group that allows web traffic over the standard HTTP and HTTPS ports.

```hcl
# Create Security Group - Web Traffic
resource "aws_security_group" "vpc-web" {
  name        = "vpc-web-${terraform.workspace}"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.vpc.id
  description = "Web Traffic"
  ingress {
    description = "Allow Port 80"
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "Allow Port 443"
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    description = "Allow all ip and ports outbound"
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "vpc-ping" {
  name        = "vpc-ping"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.vpc.id
  description = "ICMP for Ping Access"
  ingress {
    description = "Allow ICMP Traffic"
    from_port   = -1
    to_port     = -1
    protocol    = "icmp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  egress {
    description = "Allow all ip and ports outboun"
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

## Task 3: Create a connection block using your keypair module outputs.

Replace the aws_instance" "ubuntu_server" resource block in your `main.tf` with the code below to deploy and Ubuntu server, associate the AWS Key, Security Group and connection block for Terraform to connect to your instance:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "ubuntu_server" {
  ami                         = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type               = "t3.micro"
  subnet_id                   = aws_subnet.public_subnets["public_subnet_1"].id
  security_groups             = [aws_security_group.vpc-ping.id, aws_security_group.ingress-ssh.id, aws_security_group.vpc-web.id] 
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  key_name                    = aws_key_pair.generated.key_name
  connection {
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = tls_private_key.generated.private_key_pem
    host        = self.public_ip
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "Ubuntu EC2 Server"
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [security_groups]
  }

}
```

You will notice that we are referencing other resource blocks via Terraform interpolation syntax to associate the security group, keypair and private key for the connection to our instance. The value of `self` refers to the resource defined by the current block. So `self.public_ip` refers to the public IP address of our `aws_instance.web`.

## Task 4: Use the `local-exec` provisioner to change permissions on your local SSH Key

The `local-exec` provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created. We will utilize a `local-exec` provisioner to make sure our private key is permissioned correctly. This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource.

Update the aws_instance" "ubuntu_server" resource block in your `main.tf` to call a `local-exec` provisioner:

```hcl
# Leave the first part of the block unchanged and create our `local-exec` provisioner
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "chmod 600 ${local_file.private_key_pem.filename}"
  }
```

## Task 5: Create a `remote-exec` provisioner block to pull down web application.

The `remote-exec` provisioner runs remote commands on the instance provisoned with Terraform. We can use this provisioner to clone our web application code to the isntance and then invoke the setup script.

```hcl
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo rm -rf /tmp",
      "sudo git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/demo-terraform-101 /tmp",
      "sudo sh /tmp/assets/setup-web.sh",
    ]
  }
```

Make sure both provisioners are inside the _aws_instance_ resource block.

## Task 3: Apply your configuration and watch for the remote connection.

In order to create our security group, new web ubuntu instance with the associated public SSH Key and execute our `provisioners` we will validate our code and then initiate a `terraform apply`.

```bash
terraform validate
```

```bash
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

```bash
terraform apply
```

Upon running `terraform apply`, you should see new output which includes a connection to the EC2 instance

```shell
terraform apply
```

## Task 7: Pull up the web application and ssh into the web server (optional)

You can now visit your web application by pointing your browser at the public_ip output for your EC2 instance. To get that address you can look at the state details of the EC2 instance by performing a `terraform state show aws_instance.ubuntu_server`

```bash
terraform state show aws_instance.ubuntu_server
```

```bash

### Optional

If you want, you can also ssh to your EC2 instance with a command like `ssh -i MyAWSKey.pem ubuntu@<public_ip>`. Type yes when prompted to use the key. Type `exit` to quit the ssh session.

```shell
ssh -i MyAWSKey.pem ubuntu@<public_ip>
```

```text
ssh -i MyAWSKey.pem ubuntu@54.69.29.200
